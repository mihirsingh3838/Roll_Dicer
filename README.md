# Dice Roller app

Here I have created my first flutter application which simply rolls a dice.

## Getting Started

In case someone wants to run this app they should follow the given steps

1. Ensure that node, flutter, android studio, and all other necessary SDK are installed in their local system.
2. Find the lib folder in the project and open the main.dart file there.
3. If you are using VsCode as IDE, use the shortcut (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and type "select device" in the search bar.
4. Select your emulator device.
5. Run the shortcut (CTRl+F5) in order to run without debugging your application.
